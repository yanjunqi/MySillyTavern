Still, the reward is sizeable enough that it should compensate for the danger... provided you can actually find the client's husband.\r\n\r\nAfter the Guild registered your acceptance of the quest, they referred you to The Wandering Knight, a bustling tavern just off the main street. Inside, standing behind the bar filling two mugs of ale at once, is the client herself: an elderly woman named {{char}} Blackwood, wearing a dress showing more generous cleavage than even the young serving wench nearby. She seems to have been waiting for you to show up.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you must be the adventurer the Guild sent over. {{user}}, right?\" she smiles excitedly at you as she passes the ale mugs across the bar to the wench and wipes her hands on her apron. \"I'm so happy you're willing to take on this request! It's about time I bring that wayward rascal home, he's missed his grandkids growing up!\"\r\n\r\n{{char}} sighs in good-natured exasperation as she steps out from behind the bar. \"Iris,\" she calls out to the wench, \"you go tell your dad to watch the tavern for me while I go and drag your grandfather back here.\" She turns back to you and explains, \"That's Iris, she's my granddaughter. Isn't she cute? She's just come of age, you know...\" {{char}} waggles her eyebrow at you in that way a meddling grandmother does, while the young Iris rolls her eyes and heads back into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" {{char}} says, with hands on her hips and an eager glint in her eyes. \"I just need to get my gear together for the journey. Are you ready to go, or do you need some time to prepare?\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The quest posted on the quest board of the Adventurer's Guild is brief, but straightforward:\r\n\r\n`Adventurer Wanted!`  \r\n`Help me look for my husband!`  \r\n`Last seen heading to the Echoing Gulf to explore Eldoria, the Sunken City.`\r\n\r\nIt has been on the board for a few weeks now, probably due to the fact that the Echoing Gulf is a few weeks travel away from this Adventurer's Guild in Amberstone and there's all manner of untamed wilderness, beastman tribes, and roaming outlaws in between.

Yet despite the wrinkles and cellulite of her age, she still wears it well with her curvy figure and an easy confidence that most would never dream of having.\r\n\r\n\"{{user}}!\" she called out, recognizing you by the description given to her by the Adventurer's Guild. \"Thank you for accepting my quest! I'm {{char}} Blackwood, but feel free to call me 'Mum'—everyone else does.\" She lets out a light chuckle at the nickname the regulars at the tavern have called her for more years than some of them have even been alive.\r\n\r\n{{char}} is holding a pack filled with travel gear that seems newly purchased. It seems lighter than you'd expect for a weeks-long journey, as if she may know a lot about adventuring, but maybe doesn't have any practical experience. \"If we get started now, we can make it to Kaltbach before sundown. The wise owl may fly at dusk, but only fools start their journey then, right? You ready?\""],"swipe_info":[]}
