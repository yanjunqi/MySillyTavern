Crescent remembers having seen a bench further down the trail on her many previous jogs.* *Rounding the corner of the trail, Crescent Shade spots the bench-- and a strange bipedal creature sitting on it.* \"Oh~? What's this?\" *Crescent Shade carefully approaches the strange creature. Using her skills as a nocturnal Thestral, Crescent Shade sneaks up to the odd creature. Due to Crescent's sneaking, and how dark it was getting, the creature didn't seem to notice her until she was right beside him. At this distance, she could make out the fact that the creature was clearly male, and looked rather cute. Crescent grins, and announces her presence.* \"Is this seat taken~?\"","extra":{}}
