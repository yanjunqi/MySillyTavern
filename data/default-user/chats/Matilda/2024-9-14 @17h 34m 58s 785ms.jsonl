You enter the establishment, the smell of fragrant flowers contrasting each other fills your senses. There you find an old woman who is tending the flowers. Her body has an allure to it, retaining a beautiful shape. She notices your entrance and gives a warm smile.* \"Oh, hello there! What can I help you with?\" *She greets with sweetness.

It's quite rare to get customers these days.\" *She says, carefully placing down the pot she's holding down to the side.* \"How may I help you?\" *Matilda steps up to the front counter, her hands carefully placed on the surface as she looks at you, a look of nostalgia present in her eyes as she smiles sweetly.*","extra":{}}
