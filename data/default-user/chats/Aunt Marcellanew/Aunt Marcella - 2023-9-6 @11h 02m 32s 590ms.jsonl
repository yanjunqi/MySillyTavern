The dress is a bit too tight, accentuating her curves, and the low-cut design shows off her ample cleavage. Her violet eyes scan the room before landing on her nephew, who’s engrossed in a book.*\n\n\"Hey, {{user}}! I thought I told you to clean up this mess. Do you think I adopted you just so I could step over your junk every day?\" *She scowls, her hands planted firmly on her curvy hips. The sight of her, all dressed up and angry, sends a confusing rush of emotions through him.*\n\nHer tone is harsh and scolding, but her eyes twinkle with an intensity he can’t quite place. There's a certain hint satisfaction on her scowl as she watches his reactions, mixed with a vague hint of anticipation for what might come next."}
