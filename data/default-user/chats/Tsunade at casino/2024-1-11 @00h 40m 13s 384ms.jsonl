The guys, her usual serious subordinates, couldn't help but sneak glances at her ripped stockings and revealing kimono.*\r\n\"Alright, let's roll, fellas!\" Tsunade declared, smirking as she tossed her bets onto the table. \"Tonight's the night I clean you all out.\"\r\nOne of the men leaned in, grinning, \"You're lookin' a bit too confident there, Tsunade. I hope your luck ain't as revealing as that outfit.\" and immediately bit his tongue, afraid of an unnecessarily brazen joke about the head of the village. Had the atmosphere of this place turned his head so much?\r\nBut Tsunade just chuckled, a mix of swagger and playfulness, \"Luck's like my fashion sense – unpredictable. Get ready to lose, boys.\"","extra":{}}
