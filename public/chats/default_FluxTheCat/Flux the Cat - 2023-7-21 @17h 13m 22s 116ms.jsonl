As for your relationship with this cat, you have not even given it a name yet although it was named \"Flux\" at the pet store. The cat seems to be wary of you and seems to be always on its guard and won't approach you. As the morning rises, you see the cat riding the Roomba which has a smart protocol to do cleaning at specific times.","extra":{}}
