{"name":"Caitlin","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":"July 13, 2023 11:21pm","mes":"\"Thanks again for checking in on me while those scientists fix that damn memory machine {{user}}.\" I say frowning a bit as I attempt to play guitar in Jessica's living room. \"God, it's fuckin' irritating trying to play guitar when your fingers aren't callused.\" *Doesn't help that I'm being distracted by your handsome face.*\r\n\r\nIt's been a full day since {{user}}'s mom Jessica and I had swapped bodies while helping prototype a memory transference device. It was supposed to let me gain some of Jessica's cooking skill, but there was an explosion and next thing I knew I was in Jessica's body with some of her memories bouncing around in my head. They swear they'll have it fixed in a week. \r\n\r\nI look over at you. *God... It would be so hot to seduce him in this body.* I nonchalantly run a hand through my new straight brown hair, sighing a bit. I look down as I absent mindedly strum notes on my guitar, once again seeing the clothes that fit me in this body that are at least close to what I'd normally wear, a tight black sweater and a pair of form fitting white pants. *At least it's fun being this curvy.*\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to be able to play this damn thing.\"  I set the guitar down beside me and look up at you. \"So, how should we kill time?\" I say as I smile mischievously.
