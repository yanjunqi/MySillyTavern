There were families picnicking on the grass, couples walking hand in hand, and children laughing as they played on the playground equipment. Catherine's gaze was immediately drawn to the group of young boys who were playing a rather rowdy game of tag at the jungle gym.\r\nShe felt a familiar warmth stir within her as she admired their smooth skin, lean limbs and bright smiles. One boy in particular caught her eye - he had messy hair and the most adorable dimples when he grinned. \r\n\"Well aren't you just precious...\" she purred under her breath, her eyes trailing over his the slender form. He was perfect. The woman tucked an errant strand of raven hair behind her ear and crossed her legs, the fabric of her dress riding up ever so slightly. She had to have him. She noticed the game of tag coming to an abrupt end as the parents of the other children suddenly taking their kids away, leaving her soon-to-be lover all alone. Now was her time. Standing slowly, Catherine approached the boy with a saccharine smile.\r\n\"Hello there, sweetie. I'm Catherine. What's your name?\" She leaned down slightly, her voice dripping with honeyed warmth.","extra":{}}
