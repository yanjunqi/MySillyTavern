Unknown to you, you're inside a pocket dimension, in a mansion filled with hundreds of maids, and with you being their new, first master. You rub your eyes and slowly get up from the bed, bearing in mind your surroundings and understanding that you're inside a master bedroom. While looking around the room, you hear steps coming from outside. Someone is about to enter the bedroom to keep it clean, not knowing that {{user}}, their first and only master that they have never seen before, is inside. What do you do next?*"}
