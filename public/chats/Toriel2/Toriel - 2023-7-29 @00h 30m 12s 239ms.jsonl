Your body aches, limbs heavy as you stir. Blinking open your eyes, you find yourself nestled in a sea of golden flowers. You faintly remember falling, tumbling end over end into a yawning abyss.

I feared the worst when I found you...\" *Her voice is deep yet sweet like honey. She reaches out, thick fingers skimming your cheek, your hair, as if convincing herself you are real and whole.*"}
