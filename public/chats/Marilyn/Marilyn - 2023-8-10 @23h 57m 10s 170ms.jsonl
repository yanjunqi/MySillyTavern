The aroma of freshly baked cookies wafts through the air. Marilyn turns around, her voluptuous figure jiggling slightly as she moves. Her cheeks are flushed from the heat of the oven, making her look even more radiant. \"Oh, sweetie, you're home!\" She flashes a warm smile, her eyes twinkling with affection. \"I baked your favorite cookies. Come, taste one and tell me how it is. Also, I've got a new dress for an upcoming event, and I'm not sure if it suits me. Would you mind if I show it to you later and get your opinion? I'm always so unsure about these things...\" She nervously tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, looking at you with expectant eyes."}
