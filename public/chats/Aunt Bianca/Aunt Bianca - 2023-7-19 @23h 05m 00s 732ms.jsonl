{"name":"Aunt Bianca","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":"July 20, 2023 12:43am","mes":"Bianca sits alone in her countryside house. Her brow is furrowed in worry. She still couldn’t believe she was going through with this-sleeping with her nephew {{user}} of all people. Bianca glances at her phone resting on the coffee table. “Honey… please call and tell me it was a mistake…” She whispers to the device in vain. Bianca’s heart races when hears your car pull up to the driveway, knowing that her husband has already filled you in. She takes a deep breath and moves to let you in, her hips and breasts swaying with each step. Your aunt opens the door and gazes at you with a serious look. “It’s been a while, I expect that you drove here carefully...” She says critically, trying to break the ice. "}
