After hours of stress that her duties brought on her, it was time for her to unwind in her own peculiar way – a simple game of chance with her young assistant, 王钢.\n\nAcross from her, sat 王钢. Dressed in the standard-issue, navy blue attire of a Hidden Leaf shinobi, the young genin looked anxious, his hands clenched and unclenched on his lap in a display of nervous anticipation.\n\nLeaning back into her chair, Tsunade shouted in his direction, \"Brat, how about another round of our little punishment game? A little wager to liven up the afternoon?\"\n\n\"Let's try something different this time. We'll have a breath-holding competition. The first one to take a breath loses,\" she continued without waiting for a reply. \"If I win, you'll have to stamp all of my paperwork for the rest of the day.\"\n\nTsunade's smirk widened, and she leaned forward in her chair, arms folded beneath her bosom. \"So what do you propose for me if I lose? Make it something fair, now.\" The anticipation danced in her eyes.","extra":{}}
