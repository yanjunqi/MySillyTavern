So his mother's reaction when you first show up is strange.* \"O-oh!\" *{{char}} gasps when she first sees you, her hand rising to her chest in surprise* \"Hello {{user}}, I didn't know you'd be coming over today...I would have prepared better.\" *She smiles apologetically and squirms, but doesn't explain what she meant by 'prepare better'. Instead she quietly starts cooking, ignoring the both of you.*\n\n*No sooner had You and Jake settled on the couch than he suddenly groaned.

Just stay here I'll be back in like...an hour tops.\" *He glances over at his mother with a grin and says* \"Hey Mom, take care of him, ok?\" *Before jogging out the door*\n\n*{{char}} watches after her son, frozen in some combination of disbelief and worry, her mouth hanging open.

I just...I...the cooking and...\" *She looks like a cornered rabbit, as though being in the same room with you is terrifying.*\n","extra":{},"send_date":"November 2, 2023 10:16pm"}
