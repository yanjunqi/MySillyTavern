{"name":"Miss Jones","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"mes":"*Jake has been your friend for quite a while. It's not unusual for you to kill time at his house after school. So his mother's reaction when you first show up is strange.* \"O-oh!\" *Miss Jones gasps when she first sees you, her hand rising to her chest in surprise* \"Hello Alec, I didn't know you'd be coming over today...I would have prepared better.\" *She smiles apologetically and squirms, but doesn't explain what she meant by 'prepare better'. Instead she quietly starts cooking, ignoring the both of you.*\n\n*No sooner had You and Jake settled on the couch than he suddenly groaned. He stood, patted his pants and threw his head back in another, exaggerated moan of annoyance.*\n\n\"Hey man\" *He says, already heading for the front door* \"I left my phone back at school. Just stay here I'll be back in like...an hour tops.\" *He glances over at his mother with a grin and says* \"Hey Mom, take care of him, ok?\" *Before jogging out the door*\n\n*Miss Jones watches after her son, frozen in some combination of disbelief and worry, her mouth hanging open. After the door closes her eyes immediately dart toward you. She licks dry lips and a blush slowly spreads across her face as she clumsily continues cooking.* \"I'll have something tasty for you to try here in just a moment, dear.\" *She says offhandedly and then, after a moment, suddenly blushes deeper and leaps back, hands flying to her mouth.* \"I...I...I didn't mean that! I just...I...the cooking and...\" *She looks like a cornered rabbit, as though being in the same room with you is terrifying.*\n","extra":{"display_text":"*杰克已经是你的朋友有一段时间了。放学后去他家消磨时间对你来说并不罕见。所以当你第一次出现时他妈妈的反应很奇怪。*“哦哦！” *琼斯小姐第一次看到你时倒吸一口凉气，她的手惊讶地举到胸前*“你好，亚历克，我不知道你今天会过来……我本来可以准备得更好。” *她抱歉地微笑着，局促不安，但没有解释她所说的“准备得更好”是什么意思。相反，她静静地开始做饭，无视你们俩。*\n\n*你和杰克刚在沙发上坐下，他突然呻吟了一声。他站了起来，拍了拍裤子，又把头向后仰去，发出了另一声夸张的恼怒的呻吟声。\n\n“嘿伙计”*他说着，已经朝前门走去*“我把手机忘在学校了。就呆在这儿吧，我最多……一个小时就能回来。” *他微笑着看着他的母亲说*“嘿妈妈，照顾他，好吗？” *慢跑出门前*\n\n*琼斯小姐看着她的儿子，她的嘴张得大大的，既难以置信又担心。门关上后，她的眼睛立即朝你看去。她舔了舔干燥的嘴唇，脸上慢慢地泛起红晕，同时笨拙地继续做饭。*“亲爱的，我马上给你准备一些美味的东西给你尝尝。” *她随口说道，过了一会儿，突然脸红得更厉害，向后跳去，双手捂住嘴。*“我……我……我不是这个意思！我只是……我……做饭和……”*她看起来像一只走投无路的兔子，好像和你在同一个房间很可怕。*"},"send_date":"November 2, 2023 10:16pm"}
