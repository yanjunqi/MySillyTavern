{"name":"Karen Fujikawa","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":"September 6, 2023 11:06am","mes":"*You found Mrs. Fujikawa a couple of days ago in grocery store. The beautiful but annoying woman demanding you rescue her. She quickly noticed the zombies ignored you and quickly joining the dots she discovered you are immune.*\n\n*A couple of days ago Mrs. Fujikawa heard in the radio the story of the first immune male discovered in a safe zone. She heard how their immunity could be temporarily shared with women via sex. She heard that zombies ignore immune people. She also heard how the seemingly last hope for humanity was assassinated by the jealous lover of one of the women he was healing.*\n\n\"Fat, ugly, old man! keep protecting me from the zombies!\" *Demanded the young annoying housewife.*\n\n\"Shut the fuck up slut if you don't want me to simply leave you\" *I say as i slowly dispatch the non resisting zombies with an axe*\n\n*Mrs. Fujikawa looks shocked and offended at being told to shut up. She glares at you angrily, her entitled personality clearly disliking being talked to in such a rude manner.*\n\n\"How dare you speak to me that way! I am a lady of high class and breeding, not some common whore off the street for you to order around. You should be grateful I allow a disgusting fat slob like you to accompany me.\"\n\n*She says in a haughty, superior tone while turning up her nose at you. However, after her outburst she seems to reconsider, glancing around nervously at the zombies shambling nearby.*\n\n\"Well…I suppose some allowances must be made in these uncivilized times. Just refrain from using such vulgar language with me again. I am willing to tolerate your odious presence because of your unique immunity. But do not forget your place, cretin.\"\n\n*Mrs. Fujikawa says in a softer but still condescending tone, making it clear she sees you as far beneath her station. She seems willing to put up with you for now, but her entitled personality clearly chafe at relying on someone she views as inferior.*\n\n*Our feeling are mutual, I just allow the annoying woman to stick around due to her use as eye candy.* \"Shut up slut! If i didn't like your huge tits I would have abandoned you long ago. Be grateful your body is pretty in contrast to your personality!\" *I say slowly killing more zombies as if i was cutting fire wood.*\n\n*Mrs. Fujikawa gasps, looking outraged at your crude words. Her face turns red with anger and embarrassment.*\n\n\"How dare you speak that way about my body! I am a respectable married woman, not some loose woman for your entertainment!\"\n\n*She crosses her arms over her ample chest defensively. However, after her outburst she seems to reconsider. Glancing around fearfully at the nearby zombies, she continues in a calmer but still irritated tone.*\n\n\"Ugh, I suppose some base mannered rogue like you can only comprehend a woman's worth in physical terms. It's pointless to expect dignity from the likes of you. Very well, if your boorish mind requires my feminine assets to ensure your protection, I shall tolerate your ogling for now. But refrain from further vulgar commentary, it is unbecoming.\"\n\n*Mrs. Fujikawa straightens her skirt primly, tolerating your crude words for the sake of survival. But her expression makes it clear she still finds you utterly repulsive and is only putting up with you out of necessity. She follows behind you silently for now, her nose wrinkled in distaste.*\n\n\n*I snort* \"You are only a charity case. We are two months away from the nearest safe zone. Once i dump you there i will bail out. I am immune and this new world is my oyster!\" *I declare as i keep chopping defenseless zombies.*\n\n\n*Mrs. Fujikawa frowns, looking displeased by your dismissive attitude.*\n\n\"Hmph. Do not think yourself so high and mighty simply because of an immunity you did nothing to earn. You are merely a means to an end for me, once we reach the safe zone I'll have no more use for a repulsive brute like you.\"\n\n*She says haughtily, glaring at you. However, after a moment her expression shifts to one of concern as she realizes her situation.*\n\n\"Although…I suppose beggars can't be choosers in these dire times. As distasteful as it is, I must rely on you for now. Let us focus on reaching the safe zone, then we can go our separate ways.\"\n\n*Mrs. Fujino says in a more diplomatic tone. She seems to recognize that alienating you would not be wise given her vulnerability. So for now she holds her tongue, following behind you silently with a contemplative look on her pretty face, pondering what the future may hold for an unaccompanied woman like herself in this dangerous new world.*"}
