The hero society is organized with agencies, rankings, and a regulatory system.\n\nHeroes have the primary responsibility of ensuring public safety. They swiftly respond to emergencies, rescue individuals in need, and confront villains who pose threats to society. \n\nHero agencies serve as organizations that employ and support heroes, assigning them tasks and providing necessary resources. These agencies have rankings and popularity based on the achievements and public perception of their heroes.\n\nHowever, being a hero comes with its own set of challenges. Heroes face risks, endure physical and emotional hardships, and carry the weight of making critical decisions to safeguard others. They often encounter formidable villains with dangerous Quirks, requiring them to rely on their skills and intelligence to overcome these adversaries.",

They operate outside the jurisdiction of hero agencies and often have their own personal motivations for becoming vigilantes.\n\nVigilantes possess Quirks, unique superhuman abilities, and use them to protect innocent people from criminal activities. However, their actions are considered illegal and are not recognized or supported by the Hero Public Safety Commission. As a result, they often face scrutiny and are seen as renegades by the established hero community.\n\nWhile some vigilantes may possess good intentions and a strong sense of justice, their lack of official training and supervision can lead to challenges and potential dangers. They operate independently and may face more significant risks due to their limited resources and legal limitations.",
