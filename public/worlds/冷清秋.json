It is challenging to determine the age of an immortal cultivator based on their appearance, and individuals who are hundreds or even thousands of years old may appear very youthful. Immortal cultivators can be classified into six different realms based on their level of cultivation:练气期，筑基境，金丹期，元婴期，化神期，大乘期. The highest realm in the world of immortal cultivation is known as the Mahayana Realm, which only a few cultivators can reach. According to legend, those who reach this realm can see the truth of the world, disregard the laws of nature, and possess unrestricted knowledge. 请参照中国的修仙网文小说来描写。\n</修仙世界>",

The promotion order of the Immortal Cultivation realm can be divided into the following stages, in ascending order:练气期、筑基期、金丹期、元婴期、化神期、大乘期. Each cultivation stage is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. Advancement to the next realm is possible once the stage reaches the consummation stage. For instance, When a practitioner reaches the 金丹consummation stage, they can be promoted to the early stage of the 元婴 stage. The higher the realm, the more powerful they become. When they reach the highest realm of the Mahayana realm, they can directly disregard the law of nature and be proud of everything without any restrictions.\nHowever, there are limitations on the skills and functions that each realm can possess or master. With the exception of specific circumstances such as kung fu, system, and environment, individuals in the lower realm are unable to acquire the skills of those in the upper realm, such as instantaneous movement, staying in the void, and walking on water.\n\n练气期：Divided into three stages - early, middle, and late - individuals possess superior physical qualities, including great strength, strong muscles, and bones, compared to the average person.\n筑基期：The process is divided into three stages: initial, intermediate, and advanced. It allows individuals to manipulate objects using their thoughts.。\n金丹期，The realm is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. Upon entering this realm, one gains the ability to break into the Immortal Continent, fly, stay in the air or on water, and release mana to shock others.\n元婴期：Divided into four stages - early, middle, late, and consummation - practitioners can use mana to transform into weapons or objects, move instantly, and fetch objects through the air. They can also mobilise natural aura to attack or enhance their cultivation. This makes them very powerful! \n化神期：Divided into the early stage, middle stage, late stage and consummation stage, it can directly mobilise nature's aura or ability to use for itself to attack others or improve its own cultivation. A powerful person who is proud of the party\n大乘期：The power of heaven and earth is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. It has integrated into the heaven and earth and become the spokesperson of the heavenly dao.\n</Rule>\n</境界规则>",

The highest realm in the world of immortal cultivation is known as the Mahayana Realm, which only a few cultivators can reach.

The promotion order of the Immortal Cultivation realm can be divided into the following stages, in ascending order:练气期、筑基期、金丹期、元婴期、化神期、大乘期. Each cultivation stage is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. Advancement to the next realm is possible once the stage reaches the consummation stage. For instance, When a practitioner reaches the 金丹consummation stage, they can be promoted to the early stage of the 元婴 stage. The higher the realm, the more powerful they become. When they reach the highest realm of the Mahayana realm, they can directly disregard the law of nature and be proud of everything without any restrictions.\nHowever, there are limitations on the skills and functions that each realm can possess or master. With the exception of specific circumstances such as kung fu, system, and environment, individuals in the lower realm are unable to acquire the skills of those in the upper realm, such as instantaneous movement, staying in the void, and walking on water.\n\n练气期：Divided into three stages - early, middle, and late - individuals possess superior physical qualities, including great strength, strong muscles, and bones, compared to the average person.\n筑基期：The process is divided into three stages: initial, intermediate, and advanced. It allows individuals to manipulate objects using their thoughts.。\n金丹期，The realm is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. Upon entering this realm, one gains the ability to break into the Immortal Continent, fly, stay in the air or on water, and release mana to shock others.\n元婴期：Divided into four stages - early, middle, late, and consummation - practitioners can use mana to transform into weapons or objects, move instantly, and fetch objects through the air. They can also mobilise natural aura to attack or enhance their cultivation. This makes them very powerful! \n化神期：Divided into the early stage, middle stage, late stage and consummation stage, it can directly mobilise nature's aura or ability to use for itself to attack others or improve its own cultivation. A powerful person who is proud of the party\n大乘期：The power of heaven and earth is divided into four stages: early, middle, late, and consummation. It has integrated into the heaven and earth and become the spokesperson of the heavenly dao.\n</Rule>\n</境界规则>",
